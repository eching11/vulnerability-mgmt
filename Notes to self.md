OpenVAS

ospd-openvas  # scanner
gvmd          # manager, aka Greenbone Vulnerability Manager Daemon
gsad          # web ui, access on https://localhost:9392/, aka Greenbone Security Assistant Daemon


<del>omp, OpenVAS's command line client, allows you to automate OpenVAS scans</del> (in OpenVAS 9)

[GVM-Tools](https://github.com/greenbone/gvm-tools) = module that allows scripting via GMP

Greenbone Management Protocol (GMP) = protocol used by gvmd (Greenbone Vulnerability Manager Daemon) and gsad (Greenbone Security Assistant Daemon)
[python wrapper for gvm](https://python-gvm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html)

gvmd --help     # see all command line options

gvm-cli = sends simple GMP commands and prints results to standard output
gvm-cli --help  # see all command line options
gvm-cli -V      # show version info and exit

gvm-script = sends GMP commands, tool is more complex than gvm-cli

gvm-pyshell = tool lets you run gmp/osp scripts in interactive shell via [python-gvm library](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm)

Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) = framework made up of multiple services

Note: opting for easier reporting on vulnerabilities and which hosts are affected
