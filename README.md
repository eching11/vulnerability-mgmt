### Tools Explained
Nmap aka network mapper, is a free and open source network scanner. More info [here](https://nmap.org/).

Nmap sends packets to either IP address or range of IP addresses to get host(s) info like host's addresses, services running on which ports, and OS fingerprinting. Best used for doing an initial network scan to get more information on live hosts, then you can use other tools for further analysis.

OpenVAS aka Open Vulnerability Assessment Scanner, is an open source vulnerability scanner developed by Greenbone. Commercial products and competitors are Nessus and Qualys. More info [here](https://openvas.org/) and [here on their github](https://github.com/greenbone/openvas).

OpenVAS sends packets to one or multiple IP addresses to determine versions of services running on the host(s) and also whether these versions are susceptible to known vulnerabilities. Though it has an ability to OS fingerprint, it's less reliable than Nmap in doing so. It's recommended to use both in tandem to get a better picture of the network and its hosts.

cve-search tool suite uses the Common Vulnerabilities & Exploits list, which is maintained by Mitre Corp and is synced with NIST's National Vulnerability Database (NVD), which adds more vulnerability information.

cve-search tool suite consists of python scripts that uses multiple online sources like CVE and NVD in a way that connects this treasure-trove of data into a database for easier analysis.
