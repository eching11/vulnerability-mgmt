:green_book: ACLs weaknesses - confused deputy problem:  when software that has access to resources has higher permissions than user running software
Below are common attacks that take advantage of confused deputy problem and occur on client-side:
1. cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
  - misuses browser's authority
  - ex. attacker assumes victim has authenticated into a site (i.e. Gmail) and embeds a link into a webpage or email. When the victim clicks the link, they also execute the commands the attacker has embedded in it, usually invisible to the victim.
2. clickjacking
  - aka user interface redressing
  - takes advantage of the newer features in modern web browsers. Attacker takes control of a site and places an invisible layer over a portion of the site that the victim would normally click on...when clicked, the victim executes the commands from the layer instead of what they're expecting.
  - ex. trick victims into making purchases or change permissions in their applications

Mitigations for confused deputy-related attacks: use capabilities over ACLs to manage permissions.
- capabilities = to access a resource you need to possess the token/key
- in both CSRF and clickjacking scenarios, attacker would need to have possession of tokens to execute...rendering those attacks futile.
